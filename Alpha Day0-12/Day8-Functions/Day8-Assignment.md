## Python Functions Assignment

1. **Function Challenges**:
    - Write a function for each of the following tasks:
        - Calculate the factorial of a given positive integer.
        - Check if a given string is a palindrome.
        - Find the nth Fibonacci number.
        - Compute the sum of digits in a positive integer.
        - Determine whether a number is prime.
    - Encourage students to optimize their functions for efficiency.
    
2. **Recursion Practice**:
    - Implement recursive functions for the following:
        - Factorial calculation.
        - Fibonacci sequence generation.
        - Sum of digits.
        - Palindrome checking.

### Bonus Challenge:

3. **Collatz Conjecture**:
    - Implement the Collatz sequence for a given positive integer:
        - If the number is even, divide it by 2.
        - If the number is odd, multiply it by 3 and add 1.
        - Repeat until the number becomes 1.
    - Print the entire sequence.
