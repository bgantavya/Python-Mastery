## Assignment: Organizing Kitchen Utensils Using Sets

### Background:
In our daily lives, we often organize items into sets to keep things orderly. One common scenario is organizing kitchen utensils. Imagine you're helping your family arrange the kitchen cabinets. Let's apply the concept of sets to this situation!

### Task:
1. **Create a Set for Kitchen Utensils**:
    - Create a set called `kitchen_utensils` to represent various utensils found in a kitchen.
    - Include items like plates, bowls, glasses, cooking utensils, and tableware.
    - Make sure each utensil appears only once (since sets don't allow duplicates).

2. **Add and Remove Utensils**:
    - Add a few more utensils to the set (e.g., spatula, ladle, whisk).
    - Remove any duplicate utensils (if accidentally added).

3. **Check for Specific Utensils**:
    - Check if the utensil "spatula" is present in the set.
    - Check if the utensil "fork" is present in the set.

4. **Print the Final Set**:
    - Print the updated `kitchen_utensils` set after adding and removing items.

### Real-Life Connection:
Sets are essential for organizing various aspects of our lives. Just like in the kitchen, where we group similar utensils together, sets help us manage data, analyze information, and make informed decisions. üçΩÔ∏è
