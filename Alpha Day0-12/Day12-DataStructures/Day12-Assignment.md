## Assignment: Organizing Contact Information Using Dictionaries

### Background:
Imagine you're building a contact management system for a small business. The goal is to store and manage contact information for employees, clients, and suppliers. Dictionaries are perfect for this task!

### Task:
1. **Create a Dictionary for Contacts**:
    - Create a dictionary called `contact_book` to store contact information.
    - Include the following key-value pairs:
        - `"Johhny"`: `{"phone": "123-456-7890", "email": "john@example.com"}`
        - `"kodesmiths"`: `{"phone": "987-654-3210", "email": "koders@example.com"}`
        - `"Harry Potter"`: `{"phone": "555-123-4567", "email": "potter@dobby.com"}`

2. **Add New Contacts**:
    - Add a new contact for `"Eva Brown"` with phone number `"555-987-6543"` and email `"eva@example.com"`.

3. **Access and Update Contacts**:
    - Retrieve the phone number for `"Harry Potter"`.
    - Update the email address for `"Johhny"` to `"dk.smith@example.com"`.

4. **Print the Final Contact Book**:
    - Print the entire `contact_book` dictionary after adding and updating contacts.

### Real-Life Connection:
Dictionaries allow us to organize and manage data efficiently, just like a digital address book. They're essential for handling structured information in various applications. ðŸ“š
