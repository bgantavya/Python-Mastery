# Day 6: While Loop

 A `while` loop allows you to repeatedly execute a block of code as long as a specified condition remains true. Here are the key points:

1. **Syntax**:
    - The basic syntax of a `while` loop is as follows:
      ```python
      while condition:
          # Code block to execute while the condition is true
          # ...
      ```
    - The loop continues executing as long as the `condition` remains true.

2. **Example**:
    ```python
    count = 0
    while count < 9:
        print(count)
        count += 1
    ```
    - In this example:
        - `count` starts at 0.
        - The loop continues as long as `count` is less than 9.
        - Inside the loop, we print the current value of `count` and increment it by 1 (`count += 1`).

3. **Important Points**:
    - Make sure to update the variables within the loop (e.g., incrementing `count`) to avoid an infinite loop.
    - If the initial condition is false, the loop won't execute at all.
    - Use `break` to exit the loop prematurely if needed.
    - Be cautious with infinite loops (where the condition never becomes false).

4. **Example: Countdown**:
    ```python
    countdown = 10
    while countdown > 0:
        print(f"Countdown: {countdown}")
        countdown -= 1
    print("Blastoff!")
    ```
    - This loop counts down from 10 to 1 and then prints "Blastoff!".

5. **Example: User Input Validation**:
    ```python
    user_input = input("Enter 'yes' or 'no': ")
    while user_input.lower() not in ["yes", "no"]:
        print("Invalid input. Please try again.")
        user_input = input("Enter 'yes' or 'no': ")
    print(f"You entered: {user_input}")
    ```
    - This loop ensures that the user enters either "yes" or "no."

Remember that `while` loops are powerful but require careful handling to avoid infinite loops. They're useful when you don't know the exact number of iterations in advance. Feel free to experiment and explore more complex scenarios! üòäüöÄüêç
