## Task 1: Type Conversion

1. Write a Python program that takes user input for their age (as a string) and converts it to an integer. Then, calculate the year in which they will turn 100 years old and print it.

Example:
```
Input: Enter your age: 25
Output: You will turn 100 years old in 2096
```

## Task 2: Arithmetic Operations

2. Create a Python program that prompts the user for two numbers (both integers). Perform the following operations and display the results:
   - Addition
   - Subtraction
   - Multiplication
   - Division (with proper error handling for division by zero)

Example:
```
Input:
Enter the first number: 10
Enter the second number: 3

Output:
Addition: 13
Subtraction: 7
Multiplication: 30
Division: 3.33 (approximately)
```

## Task 3: String Manipulation

3. Write a Python program that takes a sentence as input and:
   - Prints the length of the sentence.
   - Converts the sentence to uppercase.
   - Replaces all occurrences of the word "Python" with "C++".

Example:
```
Input: Enter a sentence: "I love Python programming. Python is fun!"
Output:
Length of the sentence: 48
Uppercase sentence: "I LOVE PYTHON PROGRAMMING. PYTHON IS FUN!"
Modified sentence: "I love C++ programming. C++ is fun!"
```
