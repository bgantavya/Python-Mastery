**Assignment: Greeting Based on Time**

1. Write a Python program that:
    - Imports the `time` module.
    - Retrieves the current hour using `time.strftime('%H')`.
    - Converts the hour to an integer.
    - Uses conditional statements (`if`, `elif`, and `else`) to determine the appropriate greeting based on the time of day:
        - If the hour is less than 12, print "Good morning!"
        - If the hour is less than 16, print "Good afternoon!"
        - If the hour is less than 20, print "Good evening!"
        - Otherwise (for later hours), print "Good night!"
2. Test your program by running it at different times of the day.

Feel free to customize the greetings or add more specific time ranges if you'd like!

**Assignment: Match Case Statements**

1. Create a Python program that takes user input for a command (a string).
2. Use the `match` case statement to handle different cases based on the input command.
3. Define the following cases:
    - If the command is "Hello, World!", print "Hello to you too!"
    - If the command is "Goodbye, World!", print "See you later."
    - For any other command, print "No match found."
4. Test your program with different input commands.

Remember to follow the syntax of the `match` case statement, and feel free to explore more complex pattern matching scenarios if you'd like! ðŸ˜Š
