## Python For Loops Assignment

### Part 1: Conditional Loops

1. **FizzBuzz Game**:
    - Write a program that prints numbers from 1 to 100.
    - For multiples of 3, print "Fizz" instead of the number.
    - For multiples of 5, print "Buzz."
    - For numbers that are multiples of both 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz."

2. **Prime Number Checker**:
    - Create a function that checks whether a given number is prime.
    - Use a `for` loop to iterate through numbers up to the given input.
    - Print whether the number is prime or not.

### Part 2: Nested Loops

3. **Multiplication Table**:
    - Generate a multiplication table from 1 to 10.
    - Use nested `for` loops to calculate and print the products.

4. **Pattern Printing**:
    - Write a program that prints the following pattern:
      ```
      *
      **
      ***
      ****
      ```

### Bonus Challenge:

5. **Palindrome Checker**:
    - Create a function that checks whether a given string is a palindrome (reads the same forwards and backwards).
    - Use a `for` loop to compare characters from both ends of the string.
    - Ignore spaces and case sensitivity.
