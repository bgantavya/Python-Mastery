## **What Is Encapsulation?**

- **Encapsulation** is one of the fundamental concepts in OOP.
- It describes the idea of wrapping data (variables) and the methods (functions) that work on data within a single unit (a class).
- The goal is to control access to attributes and prevent accidental modification of data.

## **Basic Level: Wrapping Data and Methods**

1. **Example 1: Bank Account System**:
   - Imagine a bank account system where the account balance is encapsulated within a class.
   - Access to the balance is controlled through methods like `deposit()` and `withdraw()`.
   - This ensures that the balance can only be changed by authorized methods.

2. **Real-Life Application**:
   - In a company, different sections (like accounts, finance, sales) handle specific data.
   - Encapsulation wraps the data and the employees who manipulate it under a single name (e.g., "sales section").

## **Advanced Level: Private Variables and Information Hiding**

1. **Private Variables**:
   - In Python, we use a convention by prefixing variable names with a single underscore (e.g., `_balance`) to indicate they are private.
   - Although they can still be accessed, it's customary not to access them directly outside the class.

2. **Information Hiding**:
   - Encapsulation hides the internal details of a class.
   - It ensures that an object's state remains valid by controlling access to hidden attributes.

## **Real-Life Applications:**

1. **Security and Privacy**:
   - Encapsulation protects sensitive data (e.g., account balances, personal information).
   - Example: Wrapping user authentication methods in a secure login system.

2. **Software Design**:
   - Encapsulation promotes modular code design.
   - Example: Bundling related data and methods into classes for better organization.
