# OOP Polymorphism Assignments

## Task 1: Creating a Simple Class Hierarchy

1. **Problem**:
   - Define a Python class called `Shape`.
   - Add a method called `area()` that calculates the area of the shape.
   - Create child classes like `Rectangle`, `Circle`, and `Triangle`.
   - Each child class should override the `area()` method.
   - Implement a method called `display_info()` that prints the shape details.

2. **Real-Life Application**:
   - Modeling different geometric shapes with varying area calculation methods.

## Task 2: Customizing Inherited Behavior

1. **Problem**:
   - Create a class called `Animal`.
   - Add a method called `make_sound()` that prints a generic sound.
   - Create child classes like `Dog`, `Cat`, and `Bird`.
   - Each child class should override the `make_sound()` method with specific sounds.

2. **Real-Life Application**:
   - Representing different animals and their unique sounds.

## Task 3: Multiple Inheritance (Optional)

1. **Problem**:
   - Define a class called `Person`.
   - Add properties like `name` and `age`.
   - Create a child class called `Employee`.
   - Add properties like `employee_id` and `salary`.
   - Demonstrate multiple inheritance by creating an `Engineer` class that inherits from both `Person` and `Employee`.

2. **Real-Life Application**:
   - Handling complex relationships (e.g., an engineer who is also an employee).
