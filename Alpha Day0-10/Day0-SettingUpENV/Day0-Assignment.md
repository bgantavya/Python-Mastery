Now Let me guide you through the process of creating your first python file.

1. Open a text editor or an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like Visual Studio Code or PyCharm.
2. Type the corrected Python code (without the semicolon):
   ```python
   print("Hello! World")
   ```
3. Save the file on your computer with the name `main.py`.
4. Open a command prompt or terminal window.
5. Navigate to the directory where you saved `main.py` using the `cd` command.
6. Run the file by typing `python main.py` and pressing Enter.

This will execute the `main.py` file, and you should see "Hello! World" printed in your terminal window.

Remember, in Python, semicolons are not typically used to end statements, so it's best to omit them unless you're writing multiple statements on a single line.
