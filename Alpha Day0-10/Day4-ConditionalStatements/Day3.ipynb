    "# Day 3: Decision Making ðŸš€\n",
    "\n",
    "## `if-else` Statements\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, `if-else` statements allow you to make decisions based on conditions. Here's how they work:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **`if` Statement**:\n",
    "   - Checks a condition. If it's true, the code block inside the `if` statement executes.\n",
    "   - Example:\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     age = int(input(\"Enter your age: \"))\n",
    "     if age < 18:\n",
    "         print(\"You are underage.\")\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **`elif` (else if) Statement**:\n",
    "   - Allows you to check multiple conditions in sequence.\n",
    "   - If the first condition is false, it checks the next one.\n",
    "   - Example:\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     elif age == 18:\n",
    "         print(\"Dekh kr chlaiyo beti!\")\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **`else` Statement**:\n",
    "   - Executes a code block if none of the previous conditions are true.\n",
    "   - Example:\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     else:\n",
    "         print(\"Enjoy!\")\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",

    "## Nested `if-else` Statements\n",
    "\n",
    "In programming, **nested `if-else` statements** refer to a structure where an `if` statement (or multiple `if` statements) is placed inside another `if` or `else` block. Essentially, it's a way to handle more complex decision-making scenarios by evaluating conditions within conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's how it works:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The outer `if` statement checks a condition. If it's true, the code block inside that `if` statement executes.\n",
    "2. If the outer condition is false, the program moves to the `else` block (if present) or to the next `elif` (else if) statement.\n",
    "3. Within the `else` block or an `elif` statement, you can have another set of conditions (another `if` statement). This is where the nesting occurs.\n",
    "4. The inner `if` statement(s) are evaluated only if the outer condition is true.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we want to determine a student's Promotion based on their exam marks. Certainly! Nested `if-else` statements allow you to handle multiple conditions within each other. Here's an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "marks = int(input(\"Enter your marks: \"))\n",
    "if marks == 33:\n",
    "    print(\"Just pass.\")\n",
    "elif marks < 33:\n",
    "    if marks > 30:\n",
    "        print(\"Can be promoted.\")\n",
    "    elif marks > 20:\n",
    "        print(\"Fill compartment.\")\n",
    "    else:\n",
    "        print(\"Year back.\")\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    if marks < 60:\n",
    "        print(\"Need to work hard.\")\n",
    "    elif marks < 70:\n",
    "        print(\"Can do better.\")\n",
    "    elif marks < 80:\n",
    "        print(\"Focus on studies.\")\n",
    "    elif marks < 90:\n",
    "        print(\"awesome.\")\n",
    "    elif marks == 100:\n",
    "        print(\"The test way easy.\")\n",
    "    elif marks => 90:\n",
    "        print(\"I am impressed.\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Greeting Based on Time**:\n",
    "    - Use the `time` module to get the current hour.\n",
    "    - Greet the user based on the time of day.\n",
    "    - Example:\n",
    "        ```python\n",
    "        import time\n",
    "        timestamp = time.strftime('%H')\n",
    "        hour = int(timestamp)\n",
    "        if hour < 12:\n",
    "            print(\"Good morning!\")\n",
    "        elif hour < 16:\n",
    "            print(\"Good afternoon!\")\n",
    "        elif hour < 20:\n",
    "            print(\"Good evening!\")\n",
    "        else:\n",
    "            print(\"Good night!\")\n",
    "        ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **`match` Case Statements** (Python 3.10+):\n",
    "    - A more concise way to handle multiple conditions.\n",
    "    - Example:\n",
    "        ```python\n",
    "        x = int(input(\"Enter the value of 'x': \"))\n",
    "        match x:\n",
    "            case 0:\n",
    "                print(\"x is 0\")\n",
    "            case 1:\n",
    "                print(\"x is 1\")\n",
    "            case _ if x != 80:\n",
    "                print(\"Not 80\")\n",
    "            case _:\n",
    "                print(\"Other value\")"
