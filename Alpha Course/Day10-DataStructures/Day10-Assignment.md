## Assignment: Lists and Tuples Manipulation

### Part 1: Lists

1. **List Basics**:
    - Create an empty list called `fruits`.
    - Add the following fruits to the list: `"apple"`, `"banana"`, `"cherry"`, `"grape"`.
    - Print the list.

2. **List Slicing and Indexing**:
    - Extract a sublist containing the second and third fruits.
    - Print the extracted sublist.

3. **List Operations**:
    - Create another list called `numbers` with values `[10, 20, 30, 40]`.
    - Concatenate the `fruits` list with the `numbers` list.
    - Print the combined list.

4. **List Comprehension**:
    - Generate a list of squares for numbers from 1 to 10 (inclusive).
    - Print the list of squares.

### Part 2: Tuples

1. **Tuple Basics**:
    - Create a tuple called `days_of_week` with the days of the week: `"Monday"`, `"Tuesday"`, `"Wednesday"`, `"Thursday"`, `"Friday"`.
    - Print the tuple.

2. **Tuple Assignment and Unpacking**:
    - Swap the values of the first and last days in the `days_of_week` tuple.
    - Print the updated tuple.

3. **Tuple Length and Membership**:
    - Calculate and print the number of days in the `days_of_week` tuple.
    - Check if `"Sunday"` is present in the tuple.

4. **Tuple of Mixed Types**:
    - Create a tuple called `mixed_data` with the following elements: `("John", 25, True, 3.14, "Python")`.
    - Print the tuple.

### Bonus (Optional):

- Explore other list and tuple methods (e.g., `append()`, `count()`, `index()`, etc.) and apply them creatively.
