# Python Assignment: Word Reversal Game

## Objective

Create a fun word reversal game where the player enters a word, and the program displays the reversed version of the word. The player earns points based on the length of the original word.

## Instructions

1. The program should:
   - Prompt the player to enter a word (use `input()`).
   - Reverse the word.
   - Display the reversed word.
   - Calculate and display the player's score based on the original word's length (1 point per character).
   - *BONUS* -- If the reversed word matches the original word, award bonus points (e.g., double the score).

2. Example Interaction:
   ```
   Enter a word: python
   Reversed word: nohtyp
   Your score: 6 points

   Enter a word: radar
   Reversed word: radar
   Bonus! Your score: 10 points
