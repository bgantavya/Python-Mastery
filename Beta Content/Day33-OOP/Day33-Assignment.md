# OOP Encapsulation Assignments

## Task 1: Creating a Simple Class with Encapsulation

1. **Problem**:
   - Define a Python class called `Student`.
   - Encapsulate student information such as `name`, `roll_number`, and `marks`.
   - Implement methods to set and get these attributes.
   - Ensure that the attributes cannot be accessed directly from outside the class.

2. **Real-Life Application**:
   - Modeling student records in an educational system.

## Task 2: Bank Account System

1. **Problem**:
   - Create a class called `BankAccount`.
   - Encapsulate the account balance as a private attribute.
   - Implement methods for depositing and withdrawing funds.
   - Ensure that the balance cannot be accessed directly.

2. **Real-Life Application**:
   - Modeling bank accounts with secure access to balances.

## Task 3: Data Validation

1. **Problem**:
   - Define a class called `Person`.
   - Encapsulate personal information like `name`, `age`, and `email`.
   - Implement methods to validate and set these attributes.
   - Ensure that the age is within a valid range (e.g., 0-120).

2. **Real-Life Application**:
   - Handling user input validation in a registration system.

## Task 4: Protected Members

1. **Problem**:
   - Create a class called `Employee`.
   - Add a protected attribute `_employee_id`.
   - Implement methods to set and get the employee ID.
   - Demonstrate accessing the protected attribute within the class and its subclasses.

2. **Real-Life Application**:
   - Managing employee records with restricted access to certain attributes.
