# Python Modules and Packages Assignment

## Task 1: Understanding Modules

1. **Module Exploration**:
   - Research and choose a Python module (e.g., `random`, `math`, `datetime`, `re`).
   - Explain its purpose, key functions, and any real-world scenarios where it's useful.
   - Provide code examples demonstrating its usage.

2. **Random Number Generator**:
   - Use the `random` module to create a simple dice rolling game.
   - Ask the user to roll a die (1 to 6) and display the result.
   - Repeat the game until the user decides to stop.

## Task 3: Real-Life Applications

1. **Scenario: Data Analysis**:
   - Explore the `math` module.
   - Calculate statistical measures (mean, standard deviation) for a dataset (e.g., sales, user ratings).
modules and packages are essential for organizing code and making it reusable. Happy coding! 🚀🐍
