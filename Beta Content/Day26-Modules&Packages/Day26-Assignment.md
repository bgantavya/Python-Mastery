## Task 1: Maximum and Minimum Element Search

1. **Problem**:
   - Given an array of integers, find the maximum and minimum elements using NumPy.
   - Write a Python function called `find_max_min(arr)` that returns the maximum and minimum values.

2. **Real-Life Application**:
   - Imagine analyzing temperature data over a month. You want to find the hottest and coldest days.

## Task 2: Sorting Elements

1. **Problem**:
   - Given a 2D array, sort its elements in ascending order using NumPy.
   - Write a Python function called `sort_2d_array(matrix)` that returns the sorted array.

2. **Real-Life Application**:
   - Think of a dataset with student scores. You want to rank students based on their performance.

## Task 3: Mean of NumPy Arrays

1. **Problem**:
   - Given a list of NumPy arrays, find the mean of each array.
   - Write a Python function called `calculate_mean(arrays)` that returns a list of mean values.

2. **Real-Life Application**:
   - In a survey, you collect ratings from users. Calculate the average rating for each product.

## Task 4: Matrix Multiplication

1. **Problem**:
   - Given two matrices, multiply them using NumPy.
   - Write a Python function called `multiply_matrices(A, B)` that returns the result.

2. **Real-Life Application**:
   - In image processing, you apply transformation matrices to resize or rotate images.

## Task 5: Reversing an Array

1. **Problem**:
   - Given an array, reverse its elements using NumPy.
   - Write a Python function called `reverse_array(arr)` that returns the reversed array.

2. **Real-Life Application**:
   - Consider a time series dataset. Reverse it to analyze historical trends.

## Task 6: Checkerboard Pattern

1. **Problem**:
   - Given an integer `n`, create an `n x n` checkerboard pattern using NumPy.
   - Write a Python function called `create_checkerboard(n)` that returns the pattern.

2. **Real-Life Application**:
   - Chessboards, game boards, and pixel art often follow checkerboard patterns.
