# OOP Inheritance Assignments

## Task 1: Creating a Simple Class Hierarchy

1. **Problem**:
   - Define a Python class called `Animal`.
   - Add properties like `species` and `sound`.
   - Create child classes like `Dog`, `Cat`, and `Bird`.
   - Each child class should override the `sound` property.
   - Implement a method called `make_sound()` that prints the sound.

2. **Real-Life Application**:
   - Modeling different animal species and their unique sounds.

## Task 2: Customizing Inherited Behavior

1. **Problem**:
   - Create a class called `Vehicle`.
   - Add properties like `make`, `model`, and `year`.
   - Implement a method called `start_engine()` that prints a generic message.
   - Create a child class called `Car`.
   - Override the `start_engine()` method to print a car-specific message.

2. **Real-Life Application**:
   - Representing vehicles with common and specific behaviors.

## Task 3: Multiple Inheritance (Optional)

1. **Problem**:
   - Define a class called `Person`.
   - Add properties like `name` and `age`.
   - Create a child class called `Employee`.
   - Add properties like `employee_id` and `salary`.
   - Demonstrate multiple inheritance by creating an `Engineer` class that inherits from both `Person` and `Employee`.

2. **Real-Life Application**:
   - Handling complex relationships (e.g., an engineer who is also an employee).
