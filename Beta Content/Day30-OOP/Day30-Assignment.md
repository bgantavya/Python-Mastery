## Task 1: Creating a Simple Class with Constructor

1. **Problem**:
   - Define a Python class called `Book`.
   - Add properties like `title`, `author`, and `year`.
   - Implement a constructor (`__init__`) that initializes these properties.
   - Create an instance of the `Book` class and set its attributes.
   - Implement a method called `display_info()` that prints the book details.

2. **Real-Life Application**:
   - Modeling books in a library catalog.

## Task 2: Customizing Constructors

1. **Problem**:
   - Create a class called `Employee`.
   - Customize the constructor to accept parameters like `name`, `employee_id`, and `salary`.
   - Implement a method called `get_details()` that displays employee information.

2. **Real-Life Application**:
   - Managing employee records in a company database.

## Task 3: Multiple Constructors (Alternative Approach)

1. **Problem**:
   - Define a class called `Rectangle`.
   - Create two constructors:
     - One that accepts `length` and `width`.
     - Another that accepts `diagonal` (from which you calculate `length` and `width`).
   - Implement a method called `calculate_area()` that computes the rectangle's area.

2. **Real-Life Application**:
   - Handling different ways of specifying rectangle dimensions.
